# Avail Keystore Module
This is a library written in java to handle storage of keys in the android keystore. This work is derived from [react-native-keychain](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-keychain) and has been changed to cater for storage of
private and viewing keys locally on android device. Once can interact with this module in rust through [JNI-Bindings](https://docs.rs/jni/latest/jni/).

> [!CAUTION]
> This module has not been audited and is currently in development and testing. This is not yet ready for use and we offer no liability for any loss of keys and any implications that come from that loss.
